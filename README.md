Transaction generator for AML Cloud users.

Those users (Compliance Specialists) who define AML rules need test data samples to test rules on.

The purpose of this app is to configure individual entities (for instance a bank customer or a superfund member) with paramters of their income and spending. Based on those parameters transactions should be generated.

Intended features:
- Show list of en
- Configure individual entity parameters: income, min balance, recurring and random spending
- Define transaction range parameters: period
- Define additional specific transactions (for rule testing)
- See entity transactions
- Combine entities' transaction into sets
- Export transactions into CSV (to be imported into amlcloud.io)

This repo is only the front-end of the app and it is built with Flutter backed by Firebase Firestore. (Another repository will be created to define server functions, which will serve as a back-end of the application).

Another goal of the project is educational, therefore there is an embeded sandbox for Widget testing added to it for better efficiency (experimental).
